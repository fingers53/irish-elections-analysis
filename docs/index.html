    <h1>What 100 Years of Irish Elections Tell Us About Winning</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A data-driven dive into 36,000 candidate records reveals the mathematics of victory in Ireland's unique electoral system</p>
</div>

<article>

<p>Ireland uses one of the most complex voting systems in the world: Single Transferable Vote (STV) with multi-seat constituencies. Voters rank candidates by preference, and votes are transferred when candidates are elected or eliminated until all seats are filled.</p>

<p>But what does it actually take to win under this system?</p>

<p>I analyzed over 36,000 candidate records spanning 100 years of Irish elections (1920&ndash;2020) to find out. The results reveal surprising patterns about party efficiency, the rise and fall of independents, and just how far STV's transfer system can stretch.</p>

<h2>The Magic Number: 82% of Quota</h2>

<img src="viz_quota_distribution.png" alt="Quota distribution for winners vs losers">

<p>Under STV, each constituency has a <strong>quota</strong> &mdash; the minimum number of votes needed to guarantee election. It's calculated as:</p>

<code>Quota = (Total Valid Votes / (Seats + 1)) + 1</code>

<p><strong>Key Finding</strong>: Winning candidates typically receive <strong>82% of the quota</strong> on first preference votes alone. Losers average just <strong>25%</strong>.</p>

<p>This gap &mdash; 57 percentage points &mdash; is the difference between victory and defeat in Irish politics. While STV allows for vote transfers from eliminated candidates, the data shows that first preferences remain the dominant factor.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Winners</th><th>Losers</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Mean quota ratio</td><td>84.5%</td><td>28.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Median quota ratio</td><td>82%</td><td>25%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>32.5%</td><td>22.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>The Extremes of STV: Winning Without Votes</h2>

<p>STV can produce outcomes that look impossible at first glance. The most striking examples are candidates who won their seats with almost no first-preference votes &mdash; carried entirely by transfers from other candidates.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Candidate</th><th>Constituency</th><th>Quota Ratio</th><th>How They Won</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1923</td><td>Brian O'Higgins</td><td>Clare</td><td><strong>2%</strong></td><td>&Eacute;amon de Valera's massive surplus</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2007</td><td>Cyprian Brady</td><td>Dublin Central</td><td><strong>14%</strong></td><td>Bertie Ahern's surplus transfers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1982</td><td>Denis Foley</td><td>Kerry North</td><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td>Late transfers from eliminated candidates</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Brian O'Higgins won his seat with just <strong>2% of the quota</strong> on first preferences &mdash; around 500 votes in a constituency where the quota was over 10,000. He was carried by transfers from &Eacute;amon de Valera, who had a huge personal vote. It remains one of the most extreme examples of STV's transfer mechanism in action.</p>

<p>Cyprian Brady's 2007 win was controversial. He was Bertie Ahern's running mate in Dublin Central, and Ahern's office sent a letter to 30,000 constituents asking for second preferences for Brady. With only 939 first-preference votes, Brady was elected on Ahern's surplus. It showed both the power and the limits of vote management &mdash; Brady lost his seat at the next election when Ahern was no longer on the ballot.</p>

<p>These cases highlight something fundamental about STV: first preferences dominate, but in the right circumstances, a well-placed candidate can ride someone else's coattails all the way to the D&aacute;il.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Sinn F&eacute;in: From 0% to 88%</h2>

<img src="viz_sinn_fein_rise.png" alt="Sinn Féin win rate over time">

<p>One of the most dramatic stories in the data is Sinn F&eacute;in's electoral trajectory.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, Sinn F&eacute;in candidates won <strong>0%</strong> of their races. Throughout the 1980s: still 0%. Even by 1997, they had won just <strong>one</strong> D&aacute;il seat.</p>

<p>Then came 2020.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Decade</th><th>Wins</th><th>Win Rate</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1960s</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1980s</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1990s</td><td>1</td><td>1.8%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2000s</td><td>9</td><td>11.5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2010s</td><td>37</td><td>40.7%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2020</td><td>37</td><td><strong>88.1%</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<p>In 2020, Sinn F&eacute;in ran 42 candidates and <strong>37 won</strong> &mdash; an efficiency rate of 88.1%. This wasn't just a good result; it was the most efficient major party campaign in modern Irish electoral history.</p>

<p>The lesson? Sinn F&eacute;in ran exactly as many candidates as they could realistically win. This strategic discipline is rare in Irish politics, where parties often "spread the vote" across multiple candidates.</p>

<h2>Where Did the Left-Wing Vote Go?</h2>

<img src="viz_labour_sf_mirror.png" alt="Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in vote share over time">

<p>Sinn F&eacute;in's rise didn't happen in a vacuum. There's a persistent pool of left-wing voters in Ireland, and the data shows it moving between parties like water finding its level.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Labour</th><th>Sinn F&eacute;in</th><th>Left Total</th></tr>
    <tr><td>2002</td><td>10.7%</td><td>6.6%</td><td>18.5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2007</td><td>9.9%</td><td>7.0%</td><td>18.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2011</td><td><strong>19.4%</strong></td><td>9.9%</td><td>31.7%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2016</td><td>6.6%</td><td><strong>13.9%</strong></td><td>27.6%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2020</td><td>4.4%</td><td><strong>24.5%</strong></td><td>34.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In 2011, Labour ran on a moderately anti-austerity platform and surged to 19.4% &mdash; their best ever result. They then entered coalition with Fine Gael and implemented the very austerity programme they'd campaigned against. The punishment was swift: by 2016, Labour collapsed to 6.6%, losing two-thirds of their voters in a single election.</p>

<img src="viz_left_vote_pool.png" alt="Left-wing vote pool breakdown over time">

<p>Sinn F&eacute;in absorbed much of that vote, but not all of it. The total left-wing pool actually grew from 18% to 35% over this period, suggesting that austerity politics activated voters who hadn't previously supported any left party. People Before Profit and the Social Democrats also emerged as smaller beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The question now is whether Sinn F&eacute;in can hold this coalition together. Their base is a mix of left-wing economic voters and republican nationalists &mdash; two groups that don't always want the same things. If Sinn F&eacute;in enters government and disappoints (as Labour did), will voters fragment across the Social Democrats, PBP, and independents? Or will the cycle repeat with yet another party absorbing the left?</p>

<h2>Do Local Elections Predict the D&aacute;il?</h2>

<img src="viz_election_predictor.png" alt="Local and European elections as predictors of D&aacute;il results">

<p>Ireland holds local and European elections between general elections. A natural question: do these results predict what happens next at the D&aacute;il level?</p>

<p>I compared party vote shares in every local and European election since 1991 with the subsequent general election. The answer is <strong>yes, mostly</strong> &mdash; with one enormous exception.</p>

<p><strong>Local elections</strong> are a strong predictor of general election performance, with an r&sup2; of 0.84. If a party gets 25% in the locals, they'll probably get somewhere near 25% in the next general election. Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular tend to track closely between local and general elections.</p>

<p><strong>European elections</strong> are weaker predictors (r&sup2; = 0.68), partly because turnout is lower and smaller parties can overperform.</p>

<p>But the model completely failed in one case: <strong>Sinn F&eacute;in 2020</strong>. In the 2019 local elections, Sinn F&eacute;in got 9.5% of the vote. In the 2019 European elections, they got 7.6%. Eight months later, they got <strong>24.5%</strong> in the general election &mdash; a 15-point surge that no prior election predicted.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Election</th><th>SF Vote Share</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Local 2019</td><td>9.5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>European 2019</td><td>7.6%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>General 2020</strong></td><td><strong>24.5%</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<p>What happened? Sinn F&eacute;in deliberately ran fewer candidates in local elections (conserving resources) and benefited from a late swing during the general election campaign, driven by housing and health issues that crystallised in the final weeks. It's a reminder that local elections measure the political landscape as it is, not as it's about to become.</p>

<h2>The Fianna F&aacute;il Century</h2>

<img src="viz_party_seats_time.png" alt="Party seats won over time">

<p>Fianna F&aacute;il has dominated Irish politics like no other party:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Party</th><th>Total Seats Won</th><th>Win Rate</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>1,892</td><td>61.8%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fine Gael</td><td>1,161</td><td>50.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Labour</td><td>472</td><td>37.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sinn F&eacute;in</td><td>93</td><td>22.0%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Independent</td><td>215</td><td>12.3%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Fianna F&aacute;il's 61.8% win rate means that nearly two-thirds of their candidates won &mdash; the highest efficiency among major parties. They've held government for most of Ireland's history, and the data shows why: consistent performance across decades and regions.</p>

<p>But look at the 2010s and 2020. For the first time, Fianna F&aacute;il's dominance cracked. Fine Gael surpassed them in the 2010s, and in 2020, Sinn F&eacute;in matched them seat-for-seat.</p>

<h2>The Death and Resurrection of Independents</h2>

<img src="viz_independent_trends.png" alt="Independent candidate win rates over time">

<p>Independents &mdash; candidates without party affiliation &mdash; have had a wild ride:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Decade</th><th>Win Rate</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1920s</td><td>20.0%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1930s</td><td>32.6%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1950s</td><td>38.3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1970s</td><td><strong>4.8%</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1980s</td><td><strong>3.1%</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2020</td><td>15.1%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the 1980s, running as an independent was nearly hopeless &mdash; a 3.1% success rate. But something changed. By 2020, independents were winning 15% of their races and holding 19 D&aacute;il seats.</p>

<p>Why the resurgence? Several factors:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Voter disillusionment</strong> with established parties after the financial crisis</li>
    <li><strong>High-profile independents</strong> like Shane Ross building personal brands</li>
    <li><strong>The Independent Alliance</strong> providing some organizational support</li>
    <li><strong>Social media</strong> allowing candidates to build followings without party infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<h2>Women in Irish Politics: The Surprising Win Rate</h2>

<img src="viz_gender_timeline.png" alt="Women in Irish elections over time">

<p>Here's a statistic that surprised me: <strong>women have a higher win rate than men</strong>.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Gender</th><th>Win Rate</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Female</td><td><strong>14.7%</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Male</td><td>12.6%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Out of 4,811 D&aacute;il candidates in my dataset, only 484 (10.1%) were women. But those women won 14.7% of the time, compared to 12.6% for men.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that parties tend to run women only when they have a strong chance of winning &mdash; selection bias rather than a gender advantage. When parties do nominate women, those candidates tend to be well-known locally and well-resourced.</p>

<p>The progress has been slow but steady:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Era</th><th>Female Candidates</th><th>Female TDs</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1920s&ndash;1950s</td><td>~2%</td><td>~1%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1960s&ndash;1980s</td><td>~5%</td><td>~3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1990s&ndash;2000s</td><td>~12%</td><td>~10%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2010s&ndash;2020</td><td>~22%</td><td>~23%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In 2012, Ireland legislated <strong>gender quotas</strong> requiring parties to field at least 30% female candidates or lose half their state funding. The requirement took effect for the 2016 election and rose to 40% from 2023 onwards. The impact was immediate &mdash; and our data captures this inflection point.</p>

<p><strong>Pioneering Women:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Constance Markievicz</strong> (1918/1919) &mdash; First woman elected to Westminster (1918), first woman in the D&aacute;il (1919)</li>
    <li><strong>Mary MacSwiney</strong> (1921) &mdash; Elected to the Second D&aacute;il for Cork</li>
    <li><strong>Margaret Collins O'Driscoll</strong> (1923) &mdash; Sister of Michael Collins, elected for Dublin North</li>
    <li><strong>Mary Harney</strong> (1981) &mdash; Later became first female T&aacute;naiste</li>
    <li><strong>Mary Robinson</strong> (1990) &mdash; Though for President, not D&aacute;il, her election shifted perceptions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most Elected Women (D&aacute;il General Elections):</strong></p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Times Elected</th><th>Years Active</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Mary Harney</td><td>9</td><td>1981&ndash;2007</td><td>FF then PDs; Dublin SW then Dublin MW</td></tr>
    <tr><td>R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</td><td>7</td><td>1992&ndash;2020</td><td>Labour then Social Democrats</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Eileen Desmond</td><td>5</td><td>1965&ndash;1982</td><td>Labour; Cork Mid then Cork SC</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Liz McManus</td><td>4</td><td>1992&ndash;2007</td><td>Workers&rsquo; Party, Dem Left, then Labour</td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Note: Candidates who changed party or constituency across elections can be undercounted if tracked by name+party alone &mdash; a recurring data quality challenge with this dataset.</em></p>

<h2>The Geography of Power</h2>

<p>Different parties dominate different regions:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Region</th><th>Top Party</th><th>Seats Won</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>355</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cork</td><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>215</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Galway</td><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>123</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Connacht</td><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>205</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ulster (ROI)</td><td>Fianna F&aacute;il</td><td>158</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Fianna F&aacute;il's dominance is remarkably consistent across regions. But dig deeper and patterns emerge:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Labour</strong> performs best in Cork (74 seats) and Dublin (122 seats) &mdash; urban strongholds</li>
    <li><strong>Independents</strong> do better in <strong>Ulster</strong> (30 seats) than anywhere else &mdash; reflecting the fragmented politics of the border region</li>
    <li><strong>Fine Gael</strong> is relatively strongest in Leinster outside Dublin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elections Are Getting More Crowded</h2>

<img src="viz_competitiveness_trend.png" alt="Candidates per seat over time">

<p>In 1938, there were <strong>1.65 candidates per seat</strong>. By 2016, it was <strong>3.5 candidates per seat</strong>.</p>

<p>Elections are getting more competitive. More candidates means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>More choices for voters</li>
    <li>More transfer votes changing hands</li>
    <li>More unpredictable outcomes</li>
    <li>More expensive campaigns</li>
</ul>

<h2>What This Means for Candidates</h2>

<p>If you're thinking of running for the D&aacute;il, here's what the data says:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>You need first preferences.</strong> Transfers help, but 82% of winners get there on first preferences alone.</li>
    <li><strong>Party matters enormously.</strong> Independents have a 12.3% win rate; Fianna F&aacute;il has 61.8%. That's a 5x difference in your odds.</li>
    <li><strong>Geography matters.</strong> Running in Tipperary South (most competitive) is very different from Donegal East (historically easier).</li>
    <li><strong>Timing matters.</strong> The 2011 election was a "change election" &mdash; normal patterns broke down. The 2020 election saw Sinn F&eacute;in's surge. Running in the right year can make all the difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Be strategic about running mates.</strong> Parties that spread votes too thin among candidates hurt everyone's chances.</li>
</ol>
